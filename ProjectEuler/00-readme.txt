Project Euler is a website dedicated to a series of computational problems intended to be 
solved with computer programs. The project attracts adults and students interested 
in mathematics and computer programming. Since its creation in 2001 by Colin Hughes, 
Project Euler has gained notability and popularity worldwide.

This directory contains  (or will contain if i am not done) 
60  problems from projecteuler.net, as a recommendation by Amazon.
Initially I thought that I needed to solve these problems with my head - and I even tried!
Then I realized that these problems had to be solved with computer programs or algorithms
Had me worried there for a second!

Project Euler insists on not sharing the source code
so not to spoil the experience for others and to follow the rules. 
I am going to solve the problems in a compiled program so not to spoil it for others!

you can download the compiled programs, and run them from the terminal
eg:
$ cd projectEuler
$ ./01-Multiples-of-3-and-5
they will prompt you for input!
