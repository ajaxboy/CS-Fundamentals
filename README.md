### CS Material:  PHP, Python, Golang or NodeJS.


Hi! I am CJ

The files in this directory are * well known * algorithms; that I will be coding over time when studying Computer Science Fundamentals.

##### Type of Code: 
Algorithms, Problems, Challenges, Contests. Practice Algo/DS in various formats.

##### Languages: 
each algorithm will be either in one or more of these languages:  PHP, Python, Golang or NodeJS

##### Purpose: 
These algorithms are implemented in everyday life; for example: the Fibonacci sequence, or Binary Trees, Sorting Algothrims, and other problems that I personally resolve from contests or sites like https://www.hackerrank.com/contests
